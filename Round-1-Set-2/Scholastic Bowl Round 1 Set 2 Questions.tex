\begin{enumerate}
    % Question 1
    \item \textbf{MATH} \\ \textit{These} processes are called greedy if they always make the locally optimal choice. Turing machines can execute any of \textit{these} processes. Big O notation (*) is used to describe the time and space complexity of \textit{these} processes. For 10 points, name \textit{these} finite, step-by-step sequences of unambiguous instructions that can be used to perform a computation. \\ ANSWER: \underline{algorithm} [prompt on \textit{program}] \backtrack
    \item \textbf{MISCELLANEOUS} \\ Name \textit{these} 1990s bands with prominent drummers. For 10 points each,
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]

    \end{enumerate}

    % Question 2
    \item \textbf{SOCIAL SCIENCE} \\ Plato once referred to \textit{these} animals as ``the only featherless bipeds with broad, flat nails (*).''
